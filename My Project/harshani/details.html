        <p> Add informatThe Gal Vihara (Sinhala: ගල් විහාර, lit. 'rock monastery'), and known originally as the Uttar.arama (Sinhala: උත්තරාම, lit. 'the northern monastery'), is a rock temple of the Buddha situated in the ancient city Polonnaruwa, the capital of the ancient Kingdom of Polonnaruwa, now present-day Polonnaruwa, in North Central Province, Sri Lanka. It was fashioned in the 12th century by King Parakramabahu I. The central feature of the temple is four rock relief statues of the Buddha, which have been carved into the face of a large granite gneiss rock. The images consist of a large seated figure, another smaller seated figure inside an artificial cavern, a standing figure, and a reclining figure. These are considered to be some of the best examples of ancient Sinhalese sculpting and carving arts, and have made the Gal Vihara the most visited monument at Polonnaruwa.ion and images about ancient places in Polonnaruwa here.<br>
		
			There are three statues that are of great interest, as it depicts the Lord Buddha in three unique positions. The seated statue shows the Buddha depicting the Dhyana mudra, while the reclining statue depicts the Parinirvana position, and is one of the most intricately sculpted statues, as the depression of the pillow, along with the lotus symbol on the side is still very visible even to this day. The standing image, on the other hand, is believed to be the Lord Buddha depicting an unusual gesture, which has led many archaeologists to believe that it is not the depiction of the Buddha, but his disciple Ananda.<br>
			
			The Gal Vihara, sometimes known as the ‘Uttaramaya’ (Northern Temple), is also believed to have once been covered in frescoes of intriguing nature, however, has long been destroyed due to the Chola invasions that took place in the 14th century. Parts of the frescoes though can still be seen if you take your time and explore the entire complex.</p><br>

		<p>	The Somawathiya Viharaya is a Buddhist Stupa situated in the ancient city of Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka. Chaitya premises is called the Somawathiya Rajamaha Viharaya.<br>
		
			The Somawathiya Chaitya is located within the Somawathiya National Park on the left bank of the Mahaweli River and is believed to have been built long before the time of Dutugamunu enshrining the right canine Relic of the tooth of the Buddha. It is attributed to the reign of King Kavan Tissa – Dutugemunu’s father – who ruled Magama. Somawathiya is therefore much older than Ruwanwelisaya, Mirisawetiya Vihara or Jetavanaramaya.<br>
		
			The stupa is named after Princess Somawathi, the sister of King Kavantissa, and the wife of regional ruler Prince Giri Abhaya. The prince built the stupa to enshrine the right tooth relic of the Buddha, obtained from Arahat Mahinda, and named the stupa after the princess. Upon completion of the stupa and other constructions, the prince and princess handed over the temple to Arahat Mahinda and other monks.<br>
